# Personal Website Project (Currently WIP)
Basic info about the project, including technologies, links, introduction and more!
## Introduction
In today's digital age, a personal website serves as the cornerstone of a professional's online identity. With that philosophy in mind, I created this website to highlight my projects, share my thoughts, and facilitate connections with fellow developers and potential employers. The website features a clean, responsive design, a dynamic blog, and a portfolio section that together present my work and ideas in the best light.
## Logos and Images
All logos and images on this website were generated by GPT's Dall-E AI Image generator

## Technologies Used
### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs without leaving your HTML. Unlike other CSS frameworks that come with predefined components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that you can build upon to create bespoke designs. It emphasizes rapid UI development, and its approach encourages consistency across the design with the help of a configuration file to manage styles centrally.

### Next.js
Next.js is a powerful React framework built for production. It provides features like server-side rendering and static site generation that help create fast and efficient web applications. Next.js is designed to support features like code splitting, optimized image loading, and API routes, which simplifies building full-fledged applications with React. It's particularly favored for its ability to enhance performance and improve SEO capabilities of web applications.

These technologies have been chosen to ensure the website is not only visually appealing but also performs well across all platforms.
