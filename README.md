# Personal Website Project
Basic info about the project, including technologies, links, introduction and more!
## Introduction
In today's digital age, a personal website serves as the cornerstone of a professional's online identity. With that philosophy in mind, I created this website to highlight my projects, share my thoughts, and facilitate connections with fellow developers and potential employers. The website features a clean, responsive design, a dynamic blog, and a portfolio section that together present my work and ideas in the best light.
